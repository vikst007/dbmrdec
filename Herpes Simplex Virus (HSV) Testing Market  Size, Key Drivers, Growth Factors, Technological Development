**Segments**

- **Type**: The HSV testing market is segmented based on type into serology test and nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). Serology tests detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the virus, while NAAT directly detects the genetic material of the virus. This segment differentiation is crucial in determining the appropriate testing method based on the specific requirements of healthcare providers and patients.

- **End-User**: The market is further segmented by end-users, including hospitals, diagnostic centers, clinics, and research laboratories. Each end-user segment has different testing volume demands and budget considerations, influencing the choice of testing kits and equipment required for accurate and timely HSV testing.

- **Application**: HSV testing is also categorized based on its application in diagnosing herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infections. The differentiation is essential as HSV-1 is more commonly associated with oral outbreaks, while HSV-2 primarily affects the genital area. Understanding the specific application helps in tailoring testing strategies and treatment plans effectively for patients.
