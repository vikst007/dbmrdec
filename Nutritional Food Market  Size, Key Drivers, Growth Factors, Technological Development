One emerging trend in the market is the rising demand for plant-based nutritional products as consumers seek sustainable and ethical food options. Companies that focus on plant-based offerings, such as Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, are gaining traction among health-conscious consumers looking for alternatives to traditional animal-derived products.
