**Segments**

- By Vessel Type: The LNG carrier market can be segmented based on the vessel types such as Moss type, Membrane type, SPB type, and others. Moss type carriers have a spherical storage tank supported by cylindrical skirts, offering high reliability and durability. Membrane type carriers use a membrane system for containment, providing flexibility and enhanced efficiency. SPB type carriers have a cargo containment system consisting of a bi-convex shape structure, ensuring safety and reduced construction costs.

- By Capacity: Capacity segmentation includes small-scale carriers (1,000-49,999 cu.m.), midscale carriers (50,000-99,999 cu.m.), and large-scale carriers (above 100,000 cu.m.). Small-scale carriers are preferred for short-distance transport and distribution to remote regions. Midscale carriers are utilized for medium-distance routes, while large-scale carriers are employed for long-haul transportation of LNG.

- By Propulsion Type: The market can be categorized based on propulsion types like steam turbine propulsion, DFDE propulsion, ME-GI propulsion, and others. Steam turbine propulsion systems are traditional but less fuel-efficient. DFDE propulsion offers dual-fuel capability for enhanced efficiency and reduced emissions. ME-GI propulsion utilizes ME-GI engines providing a mix of gas and diesel for superior performance and environmental benefits.
