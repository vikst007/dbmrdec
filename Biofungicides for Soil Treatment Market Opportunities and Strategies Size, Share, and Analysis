**Segments**

- **Type:** The biofungicides for soil treatment market can be segmented into microbial and biochemical biofungicides. Microbial biofungicides are derived from microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi, while biochemical biofungicides are derived from natural substances like plant extracts and enzymes. Both types have gained popularity due to their eco-friendly nature and effectiveness in controlling soil-borne diseases.

- **Application:** This market can be segmented based on applications such as fruits and vegetables, cereals and grains, pulses, oilseeds, and others. Biofungicides are widely used in the treatment of fruits and vegetables to prevent diseases like powdery mildew, blight, and anthracnose. The increasing demand for organic produce has also boosted the adoption of biofungicides in cereals and grains cultivation.

- **Formulation:** Biofungicides for soil treatment are available in various formulations such as liquid, powder, and granules. Liquid formulations are easy to apply and offer better coverage on plant surfaces, while powder and granular formulations are convenient for storage and transportation. The choice of formulation depends on factors like crop type, disease severity, and application method.

- **Mode of Action:** The biofungicides market can also be categorized based on the mode of action, including parasitism, antibiosis, competition, and induced resistance. Parasitic biofungicides work by directly attacking pathogenic fungi, while antibiosis involves the production of compounds that inhibit fungal growth. Competition biofungicides compete with pathogenic organisms for resources, while induced resistance enhances the plant's own defense mechanisms against diseases.
