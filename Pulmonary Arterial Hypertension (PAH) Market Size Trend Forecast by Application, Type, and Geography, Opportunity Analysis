**Segments**

- Based on drug class, the PAH market can be segmented into prostacyclin and prostacyclin analogs, endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs), phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators, and others. Prostacyclin and prostacyclin analogs are crucial in the treatment of PAH as they help to dilate blood vessels and reduce blood pressure in the lungs. ERAs work by blocking the effect of endothelin, a substance that narrows blood vessels and increases blood pressure. PDE-5 inhibitors help relax the blood vessels by preventing the breakdown of a key molecule involved in the process. sGC stimulators enhance the production of nitric oxide, a molecule that aids in relaxing blood vessels.

- By distribution channel, the market can be categorized into hospital pharmacies, retail pharmacies, and online pharmacies. Hospital pharmacies play a significant role in providing medications for PAH treatment, particularly for severe cases where close monitoring is required. Retail pharmacies cater to outpatients who require regular refills of their PAH medications. Online pharmacies offer convenience and accessibility to patients who may have difficulty visiting physical stores.
