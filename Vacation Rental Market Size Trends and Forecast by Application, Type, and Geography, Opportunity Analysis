Additionally, the rise of remote work and the shift towards flexible travel schedules have influenced the popularity of longer-term rentals, with more travelers opting for extended stays in vacation rental properties.

In conclusion, the global vacation rental market is undergoing a period of transformation driven by changing consumer behaviors, technological innovation, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
