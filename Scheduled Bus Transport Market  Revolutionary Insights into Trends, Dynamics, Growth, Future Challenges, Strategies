The Global Scheduled Bus Transport Market is segmented based on service type, bus type, and end-user. In terms of service type, the market is divided into inter-state bus services, intra-state bus services, and international bus services.

On the other hand, AC buses offer passengers a more comfortable ride with air conditioning, reclining seats, and onboard facilities, making them preferable for long-distance travel and premium service offerings.

End-user segmentation in the scheduled bus transport market includes public and private users. Public end-users refer to individuals utilizing scheduled bus services provided by government agencies or public transport operators. These services are often subsidized to ensure affordability and accessibility for the general population.
