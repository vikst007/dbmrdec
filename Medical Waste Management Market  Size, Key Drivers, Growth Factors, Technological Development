**Segments**

- Based on type, the global medical waste management market can be segmented into hazardous waste, infectious & pathological waste, pharmaceutical waste, sharps, non-infectious waste, and others. Hazardous waste includes chemical and radioactive waste, while infectious waste consists of cultures, stocks, and swabs. Pharmaceutical waste encompasses expired, unused, and contaminated drugs. Sharps refer to needles, syringes, and lancets used in medical procedures. Non-infectious waste includes general medical waste like gloves, gowns, and tubing. The ""others"" category includes pressurized containers and aerosols among other miscellaneous items.

- On the basis of treatment, the market is divided into incineration, autoclaving, chemical treatment, microwaving, irradiation, and others. Incineration involves the combustion of medical waste at high temperatures, reducing it to ash. Autoclaving uses steam and pressure to sterilize waste. Chemical treatment employs disinfectants to eliminate pathogens. Microwaving involves exposing waste to microwave radiation to kill microorganisms. Irradiation uses gamma rays or electron beams to disinfect waste. Other treatment methods include plasma gasification and encapsulation.

- By services, the industry can be categorized into collection, transportation, storage, treatment, disposal, and recycling. Collection involves the removal of medical waste from healthcare facilities. Transportation includes the transfer of waste to treatment facilities. Storage comprises the temporary holding of waste prior to treatment. Treatment refers to the processing of waste to render it safe for disposal. Disposal involves the final elimination of treated waste. Recycling focuses on the recovery of certain materials like plastics or metals for reuse.
