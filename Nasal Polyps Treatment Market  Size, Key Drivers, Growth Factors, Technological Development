**Segments**

- On the basis of treatment type, the global nasal polyps treatment market can be segmented into corticosteroids, biologics, antibiotics, and surgery. Corticosteroids are the most commonly used treatment option for nasal polyps due to their anti-inflammatory properties. Biologics are gaining popularity as they target specific immune responses associated with nasal polyps. Antibiotics are prescribed in cases where there is a secondary bacterial infection present. Surgery is considered in severe cases or when other treatments have not been effective.

- Based on route of administration, the market is divided into oral, intranasal, and injectable. Oral medications are convenient but may have systemic side effects. Intranasal administration is preferred for localized treatment directly to the nasal polyps. Injectable routes are used for biologic therapies that need to be administered subcutaneously or intravenously.

- By distribution channel, the nasal polyps treatment market is categorized into hospital pharmacies, retail pharmacies, and online pharmacies. Hospital pharmacies play a crucial role in dispensing medications for inpatient and outpatient treatments. Retail pharmacies cater to the general population, providing over-the-counter and prescription medications. Online pharmacies offer convenience and accessibility to patients for ordering medications.
