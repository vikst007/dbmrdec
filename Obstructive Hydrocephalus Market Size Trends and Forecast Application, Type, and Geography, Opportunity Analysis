**Segments**

- By Type: The obstructive hydrocephalus market can be segmented based on type into communicating hydrocephalus and non-communicating hydrocephalus. Communicating hydrocephalus occurs when the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is blocked after it exits the ventricles. Non-communicating hydrocephalus, on the other hand, involves a blockage that prevents the CSF from flowing between ventricles.
- By Etiology: Etiology segments in the obstructive hydrocephalus market include congenital hydrocephalus, acquired hydrocephalus, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and post-traumatic hydrocephalus. Congenital hydrocephalus is present at birth and may be due to genetic abnormalities or developmental issues. Acquired hydrocephalus can develop at any age due to conditions such as tumors or infections.
- By Treatment: Treatment segments in this market encompass shunt surgery, endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV), and other alternative therapies. Shunt surgery involves implanting a shunt system to drain CSF from the brain to another part of the body. ETV is a minimally invasive procedure that creates an opening in the floor of the third ventricle to allow CSF to flow out, bypassing the obstruction.

**Market Players**

- Medtronic plc: As a leading player in the obstructive hydrocephalus market, Medtronic offers a range of shunt systems and devices for managing the condition effectively. With a focus on innovation and improving patient outcomes, Medtronic remains a key player in this segment.
- Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc.: Johnson & Johnson is another prominent market player, known for its advancements in neurosurgical technologies for treating obstructive hydrocephalus. The company's commitment to research and development drives its presence in the market.
- B. Braun Melsungen AG: B. Braun Melsungen is a significant player in the obstructive hydrocephalus market, offering shunt systems and related products to address the needs of patients with the condition. The company's product portfolio and global reach contribute to its market influence.
- Sophysa: Sophysa is recognized for its expertise in neurosurgical solutions, including products for obstructive hydrocephalus treatment. With a focus on quality and innovation, Sophysa is a key player driving advancements in this market.

The obstructive hydrocephalus market is witnessing significant growth trends driven by advancements in neurosurgical technologies, increasing prevalence of conditions leading to hydrocephalus, and rising awareness about treatment options among healthcare professionals and patients. One key emerging trend in the market is the focus on minimally invasive procedures such as endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) as an alternative to traditional shunt surgeries. ETV offers potential benefits such as reduced risk of infection, shorter recovery times, and improved patient outcomes, which are driving its adoption in the market.

Another notable trend in the obstructive hydrocephalus market is the emphasis on research and development activities by key market players to introduce innovative treatment solutions. Companies like Medtronic plc, Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc., B.
