**Segments**

- **Type:** The global agricultural enzyme market can be segmented based on type into carbohydrases, proteases, lipases, polymerases & nucleases, and other types. Carbohydrases are enzymes that break down carbohydrates, while proteases break down proteins, and lipases break down lipids. Polymerases and nucleases are essential for DNA synthesis and RNA transcription in plants, thus playing a crucial role in the agricultural sector.

- **Application:** In terms of application, the market can be divided into crop protection, fertility, and plant growth regulation. Enzymes are used in crop protection to enhance plant defenses against pests and diseases. In fertility applications, enzymes aid in nutrient cycling and soil health. Plant growth regulation involves enzymes that stimulate or inhibit plant growth processes to improve yield and quality.

- **Crop Type:** Another important segment is based on crop type, including cereals & grains, oilseeds & pulses, fruits & vegetables, and others. Different crops require specific enzymes for various functions such as seed germination, flowering, and fruit ripening. Enzymes play a critical role in enhancing the overall productivity and quality of different crop types.

- **Form:** Lastly, the market can be segmented by form into liquid and solid enzymes. Liquid enzymes are easy to apply through irrigation systems or foliar sprays, while solid enzymes can be incorporated into soil or applied as seed coatings. Both forms have their advantages in terms of application efficiency and effectiveness.
